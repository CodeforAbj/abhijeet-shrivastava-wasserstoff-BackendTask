"I've developed a sophisticated load balancer that intelligently routes requests based on response time for REST, GraphQL, and gRPC APIs. The system dynamically redirects incoming traffic to servers with the least response time, optimizing performance. Additionally, I've implemented robust queue systems including FIFO, priority, and round-robin, enhancing request handling efficiency. For testing and demonstration, I've set up 6 servers using Express and utilized Postman for thorough testing. Demo on my YouTube channel!"
